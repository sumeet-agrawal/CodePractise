Build a spell-checking system for a text editor which suggests corrections for misspelled words in the document based on the words in the dictionary. The dictionary will contain only alphabetical characters.

 

Suggestion should be a word from the dictionary which can be derived with fewest number of operations on the misspelled word.
Transformations allowed on misspelled word are insertion, deletion or substitution of one character at a time.
Functionality to build:
addToDictionary(word) : Add the given word to the dictionary.
spellCheck(text) : Accepts a list of words in a document and validates them providing alternatives for misspelled word 
                   from the dictionary such that the alternative is derived by least number of transformations.
Example:
Text: “calender”
Dictionary: “calendar”, “cylinder”
> "calendar" requires one operation (substituting "e" with "a")
>"cylinder" requires two operations (substituting "a" with "y", substituting “e” with “i”)
Hence spellCheck should return “calender” ->”calendar” as it requires minimum number of operations which is 1 for correcting the input text.
